# plex_for_music
Repository for Scripts helping optimize Music Libraries in Plex
Plex is a great tool for listening to music especially with plexamp. However, there are some issues with keeping the database meaningful, correct and clean. As plex mostly is used for movies and tv shows, there are considerably less scripts for music libraries around.
These scripts were created for personal use to adress these issues and come with the warning that they might need to be changed for a different setting. 
Categories are:
1. Metadata Maintenance
2. Playlists
3. Interoperability with other tools.
